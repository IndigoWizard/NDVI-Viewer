# NDVI-Viewer

View and compare NDVI values of an area of interest between two time periods.

# User manual

You can create area of interest shapefiles in GeoGSON format by going to [geojson.io](geojson.io) and drawing a polygon shape then exporting it to your local machine. From there you can drag-and-drop the GeoJSON file to the app upload section and it'll serve as area of interest to which all images will be clipped.
